## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm or yarn
- Running RAG Pipeline backend on port 3000

### Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3001` and will proxy API requests to the backend at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

## Usage

### Uploading Documents

1. Click the "Choose File" button in the upload section
2. Select a PDF or TXT file (max 10MB)
3. The system will automatically process and add it to your knowledge base

### Asking Questions

1. Type your question in the input field at the bottom
2. Press Enter or click the send button
3. View the AI response with source attribution and confidence scores

### Viewing Sources

- Click on "Sources" in any AI response to see which documents were referenced
- Each source shows the document name, chunk number, and relevance score

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the RAG Pipeline backend via these endpoints:

- `POST /api/documents/upload` - Upload documents
- `POST /api/documents/ingest` - Process documents
- `POST /api/qa/ask` - Ask questions and get answers

## Development
